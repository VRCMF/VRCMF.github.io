Work experience
======
* 06 2021 - present: Research Assistant
  * Location: HUS Helsinki University Hospital
  * Duties included: Information Extraction from Clinical Text
  * Employer: Miika Koskinen (Development Manager at HUS)

Research experience
======
* Multi-dimensional Perception and Modeling of Traffic Scence Based on Structural Relationship and Migration Learning
  * Duration: 08 2019 -- 06 2020
  * Location: Macau Institute of Smart City
  * Research content: We design a multitask facial alignment framework, which combines face detection task and facial landmarks prediction task. To get the face bounding boxes, the face detection branch finds center points of faces and then regresses to their sizes. Moreover, facial landmark prediction branch directly predict 68 landmark points for each face.
  * Supervisor: Associate Professor Liang

* Analysis and Application of Crowd Behavior Anomaly in Large-scale Urban Space
  * Duration: 02 2019 -- 08 2019
  * Location: Macau Institute of Smart City
  * Research content: We transform crowd motion into frequency domain to capture frequency distribution. Feature vectors could be obtained by directional information and frequency bands. We choose VGG16 as the backbone of classification of crowd density.
  * Supervisor: Associate Professor Liang

excerpt: 'Automated medical coding, an essential task for healthcare operation and delivery, makes unstructured data manageable by predicting medical codes from clinical documents. Recent advances in deep learning models in natural language processing have been widely applied to this task. However, it lacks a unified view of the design of neural network architectures for medical coding. This review proposes a unified framework to provide a general understanding of the building blocks of medical coding models and summarizes recent advanced models under the proposed framework. Our unified framework decomposes medical coding into four main components, i.e., encoder modules for text feature extraction, mechanisms for building deep encoder architectures, decoder modules for transforming hidden representations into medical codes, and the usage of auxiliary information. Finally, we discuss key research challenges and future directions.'

We reviews automated medical coding from an exciting perspective that unifies existing deep learning-based models into an encoder decoder framework. Specifically, we discuss 1) neural encoders with recurrent and convolutional networks and neural attention mechanism and hierarchical encoders typically used for long clinical notes; 2) mechanisms to build deep architectures, including simple stacking, embedding injection, and residual connection; 3) decoder modules with linear layers, neural attention, hierarchical and multitask decoders; 4) the usage of auxiliary information such as Wikipedia articles, code description, and code hierarchy. Besides, we introduce data for medical coding, the evaluation of medical coding models, and real-world practice. We summarize the limitation and point out future research directions at the end of this review.
